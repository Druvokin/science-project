    <h1>History</h1>
    <img src="../../Downloads/65millionyearsago.jpg" alt="continent 65 million years ago" width="400" height="250">
    <p>
    In the early <strong>Cretaceous</strong>, many of the southern continents were still joined together as part of the southern
    landmass called <strong>Gondwana</strong>. Northern continents formed the great landmass <strong>Laurasia</strong>. These two supercontinents 
    shared many plants and animals dating from an earlier time when they were joined as one enormous landmass.

    <h4>Position</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
        Australia was joined to Antarctica, New Zealand and South America,
        forming the last remnant of the great southern landmass called Gondwana.
        About 80 million years ago New Zealand drifted away from the rest of Gondwana.
        </li>
       
        <li>
        The Australian part of Gondwana was located close to the South Pole.
        Southern Australia lay within the Antarctic Circle.

    <h1>Present Day</h1>

    <p>
    About 200 million years ago, all the continents on Earth were actually one huge "supercontinent"
    surrounded by one enormous ocean. This gigantic continent, called  Pangaea , slowly broke apart
    and spread out to form the continents we know today.

    <h1>Theory and Prediction</h1>
    <img src="../../Downloads/novopangea.jpg" alt="novopangea" width="400" height="250">
    <h3>Theory</h3>

    <p>
    The outer layer of the Earth, the solid crust we walk on, is made up of broken pieces, much like the shell of a broken egg.
    These pieces, the tectonic plates, move around the planet at speeds of a few centimetres per year.
    </p>
    <p>
    Every so often they come together and combine into a supercontinent, which remains for a few hundred
    million years before breaking up.
    </p>

    <p>
    The plates then disperse or scatter and move away from each other, until they eventually -- after
    another 400-600 million years -- come back together again.    
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The last supercontinent Pangea, formed around 310 million years ago, and started breaking up around 180
    million years ago. It has been suggested that the next supercontinent will form in 200-250 million
    years, so we are currently about halfway through the scattered phase of the current supercontinent cycle.
    </p>

    <p>
    The question is: how will the next supercontinent form, and why?
    </p>

    <h3>Prediction</h3>
    <p>
    Due to the theory by Alfred Wegener that the plate tectonics (or litospheric plates) are moving. If we assume
    that present day conditions persist, so that the Atlantic continues to open and the Pacific keeps closing, we
    have a scenario where the next supercontinent forms in the antipodes of Pangea.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Americas would collide with the northward drifting Antarctica, and then into the already collided Africa-Eurasia
    </p>

    <p>The supercontinent that would then form has been named <strong>Novopangea</strong>, or <strong>Novopangaea</strong></p>
